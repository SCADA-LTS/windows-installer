      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\par
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\par
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\par

\par
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\par
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\par
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\par
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\par
\par
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\par
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\par
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\par
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\par
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\par
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\par
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\par
\par
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\par
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\par
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\par
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\par
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\par
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\par
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\par
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\par
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\par
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\par
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\par
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\par

\par
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\par
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\par
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\par
\par
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\par
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\par
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\par
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\par
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\par
\par

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\par
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\par
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\par
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\par
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\par
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\par
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\par
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\par
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\par
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\par
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\par
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\par
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\par
      meet the following conditions:\par
\par
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\par
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par
\par
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\par
          stating that You changed the files; and\par
\par
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\par
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\par
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\par
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\par
          the Derivative Works; and\par
\par
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\par
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\par
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\par
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\par
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\par
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\par
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\par
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\par
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\par
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\par
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\par
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\par
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\par
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\par
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\par
          as modifying the License.\par
\par
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\par
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\par
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\par
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\par
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\par
      the conditions stated in this License.\par
\par
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\par
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\par
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\par
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\par
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\par
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\par
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\par
\par
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\par
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\par
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\par
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\par
\par
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\par
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\par
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\par
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\par
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\par
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\par
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\par
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\par
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\par
\par
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\par
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\par
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\par
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\par
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\par
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\par
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\par
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\par
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\par
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\par
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\par
\par
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\par
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\par
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\par
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\par
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\par
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\par
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\par
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\par
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\par
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\par

APACHE TOMCAT SUBCOMPONENTS:\par
\par
Apache Tomcat includes a number of subcomponents with separate copyright notices\par
and license terms. Your use of these subcomponents is subject to the terms and\par
conditions of the following licenses.\par
\par
\par
For the Eclipse JDT Core Batch Compiler (ecj-x.x.x.jar) component:\par
\par
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0\par
\par
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\par
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\par
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\par
\par
1. DEFINITIONS\par
\par
"Contribution" means:\par
\par
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\par
distributed under this Agreement, and\par
\par
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\par
\par
i) changes to the Program, and\par
\par
ii) additions to the Program;\par
\par
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\par
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\par
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\par
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\par
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\par
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\par
derivative works of the Program.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\par
\par
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\par
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\par
combined with the Program.\par
\par
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\par
\par
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\par
including all Contributors.\par
\par
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\par
\par
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\par
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\par
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\par
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\par
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\par
\par
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\par
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\par
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\par
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\par
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\par
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\par
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\par
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\par
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\par
\par
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\par
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\par
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\par
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\par
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\par
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\par
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\par
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\par
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\par
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\par
before distributing the Program.\par
\par
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright\par
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in\par
this Agreement.\par
\par
3. REQUIREMENTS\par
\par
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\par
own license agreement, provided that:\par
\par
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) its license agreement:\par
\par
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\par
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\par
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\par
fitness for a particular purpose;\par
\par
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\par
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\par
damages, such as lost profits;\par
\par
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by\par
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\par
\par
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,\par
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a\par
medium customarily used for software exchange.\par
\par
When the Program is made available in source code form:\par
\par
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\par
\par
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\par
Program.\par
\par
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\par
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\par
originator of the Contribution.\par
\par
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\par
\par
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\par
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\par
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\par
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\par
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\par
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\par
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\par
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\par
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\par
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\par
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\par
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\par
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\par
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\par
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\par
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor\par
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\par
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\par
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\par
\par
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\par
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\par
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\par
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\par
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\par
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\par
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\par
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\par
Contributor must pay those damages.\par
\par
5. NO WARRANTY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\par
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\par
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\par
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\par
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\par
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\par
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs\par
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\par
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\par
\par
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\par
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\par
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\par
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\par
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\par
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\par
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. GENERAL\par
\par
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\par
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\par
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\par
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\par
provision valid and enforceable.\par
\par
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\par
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\par
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\par
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\par
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\par
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\par
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\par
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\par
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\par
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\par
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\par
survive.\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\par
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\par
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\par
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\par
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\par
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation\par
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\par
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\par
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always\par
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\par
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\par
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)\par
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)\par
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of\par
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\par
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under\par
this Agreement are reserved.\par
\par
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\par
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\par
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\par
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\par
any resulting litigation.\par

Common Public License version 1.0\par
\par
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\par
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\par
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\par
\par
1. DEFINITIONS\par
\par
"Contribution" means:\par
\par
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\par
distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent\par
Contributor:\par
\par
i) changes to the Program, and\par
\par
ii) additions to the Program;\par
\par
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\par
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\par
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\par
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\par
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\par
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\par
derivative works of the Program.\par
\par
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\par
\par
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\par
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\par
combined with the Program.\par
\par
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\par
\par
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\par
including all Contributors.\par
\par
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\par
\par
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\par
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\par
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\par
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\par
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\par
\par
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\par
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\par
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\par
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\par
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\par
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\par
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\par
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\par
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\par
\par
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\par
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\par
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\par
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\par
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\par
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\par
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\par
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\par
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\par
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\par
before distributing the Program.\par
\par
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright\par
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in\par
this Agreement.\par
\par
3. REQUIREMENTS\par
\par
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\par
own license agreement, provided that:\par
\par
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) its license agreement:\par
\par
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\par
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\par
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\par
fitness for a particular purpose;\par
\par
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\par
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\par
damages, such as lost profits;\par
\par
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by\par
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\par
\par
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,\par
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a\par
medium customarily used for software exchange.\par
\par
When the Program is made available in source code form:\par
\par
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\par
\par
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\par
\par
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\par
Program.\par
\par
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\par
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\par
originator of the Contribution.\par
\par
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\par
\par
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\par
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\par
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\par
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\par
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\par
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\par
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\par
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\par
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\par
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\par
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\par
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\par
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\par
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\par
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\par
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\par
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\par
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\par
any such claim at its own expense.\par
\par
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\par
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\par
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\par
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\par
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\par
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\par
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\par
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\par
Contributor must pay those damages.\par
\par
5. NO WARRANTY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\par
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\par
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\par
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\par
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\par
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\par
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\par
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\par
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\par
\par
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\par
\par
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\par
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\par
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\par
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\par
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\par
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\par
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
7. GENERAL\par
\par
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\par
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\par
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\par
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\par
provision valid and enforceable.\par
\par
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\par
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\par
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\par
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\par
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\par
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\par
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\par
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\par
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\par
\par
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\par
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\par
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\par
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\par
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\par
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\par
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\par
survive.\par
\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\par
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\par
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\par
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\par
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\par
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\par
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\par
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\par
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\par
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\par
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\par
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\par
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\par
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\par
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\par
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\par
\par
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\par
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\par
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\par
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\par
any resulting litigation.\par
\par
Special exception for LZMA compression module\par
\par
Igor Pavlov and Amir Szekely, the authors of the LZMA compression module for\par
NSIS, expressly permit you to statically or dynamically link your code (or bind\par
by name) to the files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS without\par
subjecting your linked code to the terms of the Common Public license version\par
1.0. Any modifications or additions to files from the LZMA compression module\par
for NSIS, however, are subject to the terms of the Common Public License version\par
1.0.\par

3. Distribution Obligations.\par
\par
      3.1. Availability of Source Code.\par

      Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that\par
      Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.\par
      You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code\par
      form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.\par
      You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form\par
      as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a\par
      reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\par
      exchange.\par

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source\par
      Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License\par

      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to\par
      one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on\par
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\par
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,\par
      support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\par
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor\par

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the\par
      terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,\par
      which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are\par
      in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\par
      Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient.s rights\par
      in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You\par
      distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different\par
      license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\par
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer\par
      or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\par
      every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\par
      such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\par
\par
      3.6. Larger Works.\par
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code\par
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work\par
      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements\par
      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\par
\par
4. Versions of the License.\par
\par
      4.1. New Versions.\par
      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish\par
      revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each\par
      version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided\par
      in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\par
      modify this License.\par
\par
      4.2. Effect of New Versions.\par
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered\par
      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under\par
      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial\par
      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from\par
      being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version\par
      of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software\par
      available under the terms of the version of the License under which You\par
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose\par
      to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\par
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the\par
      license steward.\par
\par
      4.3. Modified Versions.\par
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for\par
      Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this\par
      License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the\par
      name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from\par
      this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains\par
      terms which differ from this License.\par
\par
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\par
\par
   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT\par
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\par
   LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\par
   MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\par
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\par
   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL\par
   DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY\par
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\par
   ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED\par
   HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\par
\par
6. TERMINATION.\par
\par
      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\par
           automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\par
           cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\par
           Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\par
           termination of this License shall survive.\par
\par
      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\par
           judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the\par
           Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim\par
           is referred to as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant\par
           Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a\par
           Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the\par
           Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\par
           any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such\par
           Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not\par
           the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2\par
           of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\par
           prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day\par
           notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your\par
           claim with respect to the Participant Software against such\par
           Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement\par
           with Participant.\par
\par
      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end\par
           user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\par
           distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\par
           granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\par
\par
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\par
\par
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\par
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY\par
   OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF\par
   ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,\par
   INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\par
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,\par
   COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\par
   LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\par
   SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\par
   DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\par
   APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\par
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\par
   EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\par
\par
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\par
\par
   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48\par
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as\par
   that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial\par
   computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\par
   (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1\par
   through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered\par
   Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\par
   clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or\par
   provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this\par
   License.\par
\par
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\par
\par
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\par
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\par
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\par
   enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction\par
   specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the\par
   extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such\par
   jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this\par
   License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the\par
   jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original\par
   Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\par
   limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The\par
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\par
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\par
   which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against\par
   the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are\par
   responsible for compliance with the United States export administration\par
   regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other\par
   countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered\par
   Software.\par
\par
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\par
\par
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible\par
   for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its\par
   utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial\par
   Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable\par
   basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any\par
   admission of liability.\par
\par
   NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\par

\pard\widctlpar\qc\cf1\kerning0 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\cf0\fs20\par
\cf1\fs24 Version 3, 29 June 2007\cf0\fs20\par

\pard\widctlpar\fs24\par
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://fsf.org/"}}{\fldrslt{https://fsf.org/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >\fs20\par
\fs24  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\fs20\par
\fs24  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
                            Preamble\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\fs20\par
\fs24 software and other kinds of works.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\fs20\par
\fs24 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\fs20\par
\fs24 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\fs20\par
\fs24 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\fs20\par
\fs24 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\fs20\par
\fs24 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\fs20\par
\fs24 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\fs20\par
\fs24 your programs, too.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\fs20\par
\fs24 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\fs20\par
\fs24 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\fs20\par
\fs24 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\fs20\par
\fs24 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\fs20\par
\fs24 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\fs20\par
\fs24 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\fs20\par
\fs24 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\fs20\par
\fs24 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\fs20\par
\fs24 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\fs20\par
\fs24 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\fs20\par
\fs24 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\fs20\par
\fs24 know their rights.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\fs20\par
\fs24 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\fs20\par
\fs24 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\fs20\par
\fs24 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\fs20\par
\fs24 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\fs20\par
\fs24 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\fs20\par
\fs24 authors of previous versions.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\fs20\par
\fs24 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\fs20\par
\fs24 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\fs20\par
\fs24 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\fs20\par
\fs24 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\fs20\par
\fs24 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\fs20\par
\fs24 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\fs20\par
\fs24 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\fs20\par
\fs24 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\fs20\par
\fs24 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\fs20\par
\fs24 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\fs20\par
\fs24 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\fs20\par
\fs24 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\fs20\par
\fs24 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\fs20\par
\fs24 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\fs20\par
\fs24 modification follow.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  0. Definitions.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\fs20\par
\fs24 works, such as semiconductor masks.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\fs20\par
\fs24 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\fs20\par
\fs24 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\fs20\par
\fs24 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\fs20\par
\fs24 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\fs20\par
\fs24 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\fs20\par
\fs24 on the Program.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\fs20\par
\fs24 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\fs20\par
\fs24 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\fs20\par
\fs24 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\fs20\par
\fs24 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\fs20\par
\fs24 public, and in some countries other activities as well.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\fs20\par
\fs24 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\fs20\par
\fs24 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\fs20\par
\fs24 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\fs20\par
\fs24 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\fs20\par
\fs24 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\fs20\par
\fs24 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\fs20\par
\fs24 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\fs20\par
\fs24 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\fs20\par
\fs24 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  1. Source Code.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\fs20\par
\fs24 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\fs20\par
\fs24 form of a work.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\fs20\par
\fs24 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\fs20\par
\fs24 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\fs20\par
\fs24 is widely used among developers working in that language.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\fs20\par
\fs24 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\fs20\par
\fs24 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\fs20\par
\fs24 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\fs20\par
\fs24 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\fs20\par
\fs24 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\fs20\par
\fs24 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\fs20\par
\fs24 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\fs20\par
\fs24 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\fs20\par
\fs24 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\fs20\par
\fs24 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\fs20\par
\fs24 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\fs20\par
\fs24 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\fs20\par
\fs24 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\fs20\par
\fs24 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\fs20\par
\fs24 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\fs20\par
\fs24 includes interface definition files associated with source files for\fs20\par
\fs24 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\fs20\par
\fs24 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\fs20\par
\fs24 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\fs20\par
\fs24 subprograms and other parts of the work.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\fs20\par
\fs24 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\fs20\par
\fs24 Source.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\fs20\par
\fs24 same work.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  2. Basic Permissions.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\fs20\par
\fs24 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\fs20\par
\fs24 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\fs20\par
\fs24 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\fs20\par
\fs24 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\fs20\par
\fs24 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\fs20\par
\fs24 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\fs20\par
\fs24 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\fs20\par
\fs24 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\fs20\par
\fs24 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\fs20\par
\fs24 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\fs20\par
\fs24 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\fs20\par
\fs24 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\fs20\par
\fs24 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\fs20\par
\fs24 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\fs20\par
\fs24 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\fs20\par
\fs24 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\fs20\par
\fs24 makes it unnecessary.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\fs20\par
\fs24 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\fs20\par
\fs24 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\fs20\par
\fs24 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\fs20\par
\fs24 measures.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\fs20\par
\fs24 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\fs20\par
\fs24 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\fs20\par
\fs24 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\fs20\par
\fs24 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\fs20\par
\fs24 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\fs20\par
\fs24 technological measures.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\fs20\par
\fs24 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\fs20\par
\fs24 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\fs20\par
\fs24 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\fs20\par
\fs24 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\fs20\par
\fs24 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\fs20\par
\fs24 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\fs20\par
\fs24 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\fs20\par
\fs24 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\fs20\par
\fs24 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\fs20\par
\fs24     it, and giving a relevant date.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\fs20\par
\fs24     released under this License and any conditions added under section\fs20\par
\fs24     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\fs20\par
\fs24     "keep intact all notices".\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\fs20\par
\fs24     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\fs20\par
\fs24     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\fs20\par
\fs24     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\fs20\par
\fs24     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\fs20\par
\fs24     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\fs20\par
\fs24     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\fs20\par
\fs24     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\fs20\par
\fs24     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\fs20\par
\fs24     work need not make them do so.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\fs20\par
\fs24 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\fs20\par
\fs24 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\fs20\par
\fs24 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\fs20\par
\fs24 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\fs20\par
\fs24 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\fs20\par
\fs24 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\fs20\par
\fs24 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\fs20\par
\fs24 parts of the aggregate.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\fs20\par
\fs24 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\fs20\par
\fs24 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\fs20\par
\fs24 in one of these ways:\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\fs20\par
\fs24     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\fs20\par
\fs24     customarily used for software interchange.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\fs20\par
\fs24     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\fs20\par
\fs24     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\fs20\par
\fs24     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\fs20\par
\fs24     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\fs20\par
\fs24     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\fs20\par
\fs24     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\fs20\par
\fs24     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\fs20\par
\fs24     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\fs20\par
\fs24     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\fs20\par
\fs24     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\fs20\par
\fs24     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\fs20\par
\fs24     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\fs20\par
\fs24     with subsection 6b.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\fs20\par
\fs24     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\fs20\par
\fs24     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\fs20\par
\fs24     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\fs20\par
\fs24     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\fs20\par
\fs24     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\fs20\par
\fs24     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\fs20\par
\fs24     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\fs20\par
\fs24     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\fs20\par
\fs24     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\fs20\par
\fs24     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\fs20\par
\fs24     charge under subsection 6d.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\fs20\par
\fs24 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\fs20\par
\fs24 included in conveying the object code work.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\fs20\par
\fs24 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\fs20\par
\fs24 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\fs20\par
\fs24 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\fs20\par
\fs24 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\fs20\par
\fs24 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\fs20\par
\fs24 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\fs20\par
\fs24 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\fs20\par
\fs24 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\fs20\par
\fs24 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\fs20\par
\fs24 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\fs20\par
\fs24 the only significant mode of use of the product.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\fs20\par
\fs24 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\fs20\par
\fs24 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\fs20\par
\fs24 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\fs20\par
\fs24 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\fs20\par
\fs24 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\fs20\par
\fs24 modification has been made.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\fs20\par
\fs24 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\fs20\par
\fs24 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\fs20\par
\fs24 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\fs20\par
\fs24 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\fs20\par
\fs24 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\fs20\par
\fs24 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\fs20\par
\fs24 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\fs20\par
\fs24 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\fs20\par
\fs24 been installed in ROM).\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\fs20\par
\fs24 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\fs20\par
\fs24 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\fs20\par
\fs24 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\fs20\par
\fs24 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\fs20\par
\fs24 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\fs20\par
\fs24 protocols for communication across the network.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\fs20\par
\fs24 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\fs20\par
\fs24 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\fs20\par
\fs24 source code form), and must require no special password or key for\fs20\par
\fs24 unpacking, reading or copying.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  7. Additional Terms.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\fs20\par
\fs24 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\fs20\par
\fs24 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\fs20\par
\fs24 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\fs20\par
\fs24 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\fs20\par
\fs24 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\fs20\par
\fs24 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\fs20\par
\fs24 this License without regard to the additional permissions.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\fs20\par
\fs24 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\fs20\par
\fs24 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\fs20\par
\fs24 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\fs20\par
\fs24 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\fs20\par
\fs24 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\fs20\par
\fs24 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\fs20\par
\fs24 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\fs20\par
\fs24     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\fs20\par
\fs24     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\fs20\par
\fs24     Notices displayed by works containing it; or\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\fs20\par
\fs24     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\fs20\par
\fs24     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\fs20\par
\fs24     authors of the material; or\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\fs20\par
\fs24     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\fs20\par
\fs24     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\fs20\par
\fs24     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\fs20\par
\fs24     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\fs20\par
\fs24     those licensors and authors.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\fs20\par
\fs24 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\fs20\par
\fs24 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\fs20\par
\fs24 governed by this License along with a term that is a further\fs20\par
\fs24 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\fs20\par
\fs24 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\fs20\par
\fs24 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\fs20\par
\fs24 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\fs20\par
\fs24 not survive such relicensing or conveying.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\fs20\par
\fs24 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\fs20\par
\fs24 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\fs20\par
\fs24 where to find the applicable terms.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\fs20\par
\fs24 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\fs20\par
\fs24 the above requirements apply either way.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  8. Termination.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\fs20\par
\fs24 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\fs20\par
\fs24 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\fs20\par
\fs24 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\fs20\par
\fs24 paragraph of section 11).\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\fs20\par
\fs24 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\fs20\par
\fs24 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\fs20\par
\fs24 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\fs20\par
\fs24 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\fs20\par
\fs24 prior to 60 days after the cessation.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\fs20\par
\fs24 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\fs20\par
\fs24 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\fs20\par
\fs24 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\fs20\par
\fs24 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\fs20\par
\fs24 your receipt of the notice.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\fs20\par
\fs24 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\fs20\par
\fs24 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\fs20\par
\fs24 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\fs20\par
\fs24 material under section 10.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\fs20\par
\fs24 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\fs20\par
\fs24 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\fs20\par
\fs24 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\fs20\par
\fs24 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\fs20\par
\fs24 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\fs20\par
\fs24 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\fs20\par
\fs24 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\fs20\par
\fs24 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\fs20\par
\fs24 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\fs20\par
\fs24 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\fs20\par
\fs24 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\fs20\par
\fs24 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\fs20\par
\fs24 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\fs20\par
\fs24 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\fs20\par
\fs24 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\fs20\par
\fs24 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\fs20\par
\fs24 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\fs20\par
\fs24 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\fs20\par
\fs24 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\fs20\par
\fs24 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\fs20\par
\fs24 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\fs20\par
\fs24 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\fs20\par
\fs24 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\fs20\par
\fs24 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  11. Patents.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\fs20\par
\fs24 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\fs20\par
\fs24 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\fs20\par
\fs24 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\fs20\par
\fs24 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\fs20\par
\fs24 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\fs20\par
\fs24 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\fs20\par
\fs24 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\fs20\par
\fs24 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\fs20\par
\fs24 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\fs20\par
\fs24 this License.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\fs20\par
\fs24 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\fs20\par
\fs24 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\fs20\par
\fs24 propagate the contents of its contributor version.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\fs20\par
\fs24 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\fs20\par
\fs24 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\fs20\par
\fs24 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\fs20\par
\fs24 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\fs20\par
\fs24 patent against the party.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\fs20\par
\fs24 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\fs20\par
\fs24 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\fs20\par
\fs24 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\fs20\par
\fs24 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\fs20\par
\fs24 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\fs20\par
\fs24 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\fs20\par
\fs24 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\fs20\par
\fs24 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\fs20\par
\fs24 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\fs20\par
\fs24 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\fs20\par
\fs24 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\fs20\par
\fs24 country that you have reason to believe are valid.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\fs20\par
\fs24 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\fs20\par
\fs24 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\fs20\par
\fs24 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\fs20\par
\fs24 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\fs20\par
\fs24 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\fs20\par
\fs24 work and works based on it.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\fs20\par
\fs24 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\fs20\par
\fs24 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\fs20\par
\fs24 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\fs20\par
\fs24 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\fs20\par
\fs24 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\fs20\par
\fs24 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\fs20\par
\fs24 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\fs20\par
\fs24 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\fs20\par
\fs24 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\fs20\par
\fs24 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\fs20\par
\fs24 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\fs20\par
\fs24 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\fs20\par
\fs24 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\fs20\par
\fs24 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\fs20\par
\fs24 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\fs20\par
\fs24 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\fs20\par
\fs24 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\fs20\par
\fs24 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\fs20\par
\fs24 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\fs20\par
\fs24 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\fs20\par
\fs24 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\fs20\par
\fs24 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\fs20\par
\fs24 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\fs20\par
\fs24 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\fs20\par
\fs24 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\fs20\par
\fs24 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\fs20\par
\fs24 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\fs20\par
\fs24 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\fs20\par
\fs24 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\fs20\par
\fs24 combination as such.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\fs20\par
\fs24 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\fs20\par
\fs24 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\fs20\par
\fs24 address new problems or concerns.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\fs20\par
\fs24 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\fs20\par
\fs24 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\fs20\par
\fs24 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\fs20\par
\fs24 version or of any later version published by the Free Software\fs20\par
\fs24 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\fs20\par
\fs24 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\fs20\par
\fs24 by the Free Software Foundation.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\fs20\par
\fs24 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\fs20\par
\fs24 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\fs20\par
\fs24 to choose that version for the Program.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\fs20\par
\fs24 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\fs20\par
\fs24 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\fs20\par
\fs24 later version.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\fs20\par
\fs24 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\fs20\par
\fs24 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\fs20\par
\fs24 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\fs20\par
\fs24 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\fs20\par
\fs24 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\fs20\par
\fs24 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\fs20\par
\fs24 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  16. Limitation of Liability.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\fs20\par
\fs24 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\fs20\par
\fs24 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\fs20\par
\fs24 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\fs20\par
\fs24 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\fs20\par
\fs24 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\fs20\par
\fs24 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\fs20\par
\fs24 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\fs20\par
\fs24 SUCH DAMAGES.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\fs20\par
\fs24 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\fs20\par
\fs24 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\fs20\par
\fs24 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\fs20\par
\fs24 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\fs20\par
\fs24 copy of the Program in return for a fee.\fs20\par
\fs24\par

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\fs20\par
\fs24 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\fs20\par
\fs24 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\fs20\par
\fs24 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\fs20\par
\fs24 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\fs20\par
\fs24 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\fs20\par
\fs24     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\fs20\par
\fs24     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\fs20\par
\fs24     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\fs20\par
\fs24     (at your option) any later version.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\fs20\par
\fs24     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\fs20\par
\fs24     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\fs20\par
\fs24     GNU General Public License for more details.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\fs20\par
\fs24     along with this program.  If not, see <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\fs20\par
\fs24 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\fs20\par
\fs24\par
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\fs20\par
\fs24     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\fs20\par
\fs24     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\fs20\par
\fs24     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\fs20\par
\fs24\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\fs20\par
\fs24 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\fs20\par
\fs24 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".\fs20\par
\fs24\par
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\fs20\par
\fs24 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.\fs20\par

\fs24\par
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\fs20\par
\fs24 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\fs20\par
\fs24 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\fs20\par
\fs24 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\fs20\par
\fs24 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read\fs20\par
