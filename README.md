# Scada-LTS
Installer for Scada-LTS developed with Inno Setup.

If you are looking for the Scada-LTS installer `.exe` file, see the [Scada-LTS repository releases](https://github.com/SCADA-LTS/Scada-LTS/releases/latest).

The main installer script (`Scada-LTS.iss`) may be modified and adapted under the terms of the MIT license. The other files in this repository (Tomcat, Scada-LTS Builds, etc) have different licenses.

Feel free to _fork_ this repository and create installers for your own versions of Scada-LTS.
